      <description>Features Game-Modes The game is divided into two segments. A single player mode where each of our simple games can be played separately from others.
In the endless mode you can play until you run out of hearts. In this mode two randomly selected games of matching genres are displayed in parallel, on the right and left side respectively, and can be played simultaneously.
The skilled ones should start with the Parallel-Mode.</description>

By implementing simple functions such as pressing a button or moving the control stick in one direction, every gamer&amp;rsquo;s heart is addressed.</description>
