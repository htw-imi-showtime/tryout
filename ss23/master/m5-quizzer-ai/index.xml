      <description>üìã Process In our project, we managed the process using a Trello board, a helpful tool for organizing tasks and responsibilities. The Kanban board allowed us to efficiently distribute tasks among the team members and track the progress of each assignment. This method facilitated clear communication and coordination throughout the project, ensuring that everyone knew their roles and deadlines. We also held meeting sessions every Monday via Microsoft Teams. This helped us stay on track, kept us in discussion, and we were able to plan ahead for the current week.</description>

      <description>üíª Development The project was built upon an existing prototype, reducing the need for starting from scratch. Flutter, a Google-developed open-source framework for cross-platform app development, was chosen for the UI. It utilizes Dart, a programming language tightly integrated with Flutter. The Isar database is a robust Flutter package that seamlessly integrates databases. It offers fast performance, supports various data types, and facilitates efficient data filtering. Additionally, it optimizes offline usage and benefits from a strong community support, making it a reliable data management solution for Flutter applications.</description>

      <description>üßä bloc integration We&amp;rsquo;re planning to expand our Flutter application by integrating Bloc for state management. Bloc is a state management design pattern and architecture used in Flutter to handle the flow of data and manage the state of an application. It is specifically designed to simplify and structure the way an app&amp;rsquo;s state is handled and updated. One of the main advantages of using Bloc for state management is that it helps to maintain a clear separation of concerns.</description>
