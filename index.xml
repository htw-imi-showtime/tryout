      <description>Features Game-Flow The game is divided into two segments. A single player mode where each of our simple games can be played separately from others.
In the endless mode where you can play until you run out of hearts. In this mode two randomly selected games of matching genres are displayed in parallel, on the right and left side respectively, and can be played simultaneously.
Level Systems Our games have four different levels.</description>

      <description>Chatbot: A chatbot, heart of our software, should offer the user a pleasant and intuitive solution to deal with the cyber security of his system, using natural language only. The artificial intelligence classifies the user input and reacts accordingly. It also recognizes previous results and can base new audits on them. An active scan can always be monitored by the user through logs. Results can be viewed permanently at any time.</description>

      <description>ðŸ“• Embeddings Embedding of user-supplied information: As the knowledge of OpenAI&amp;rsquo;s models is limited with a cutoff date in time and lack of really specific information, more recent or specialized information is unavailable to the AI. To counter this, we are using embeddings to inject our information into the AI prompts. Hereby, chunks of information, like paragraphs, are transformed into a vector space. These vectors capture semantic relationships and patterns to be able to classify their textual content.</description>

      <description>Features To monitor heart rate, which is a measure of stress, we have integrated a Bluetooth interface into the framework. A paired heart rate device passes on its measured data to VamX. The course of the heart rate is displayed as a graph in the framework in real time.
VamX and heart rate measuring instrument are connected via bluetooth. For testing the framework we have developed three VR games. Based on their different characteristics, various predictions and scenarios are to be drawn for one&amp;rsquo;s own application.</description>

      <description>Process To start with, we first had to define what a mini-game looks like. As we were able to determine, it was not so easy to commit to the necessary functions. We decided to look at the mini-games as a whole and to view our &amp;ldquo;mini-games&amp;rdquo; as individual tasks of a gaming experience. By implementing simple functions such as pressing a button or moving the control stick in one direction, every gamer&amp;rsquo;s heart is addressed.</description>

      <description>Process We started the project with a brainstorming phase to come up with realistic use cases, which can be done in the given time and with regard of our skills. There were multiple different ideas like a chat assistant and including the OpenAI speech recognition Whisper. Finally we decided on 3 use cases to explore: curated shopping list, product comparison and a product summary.
The first week was focused on onboarding, reading OpenAI documentation and prompt engineering to test feasability of our selected use cases.</description>

      <description>Organization / Team management Project management was mainly done via GitLab, with the GitLab server provided by our project supervisors David Koschnick (Product Owner) and Christoph Bork (Stakeholder). We followed agile methods and focused primarily on scrum-like project management. However, due to the small size, we made some deviations from a pure scrum approach.
At the beginning of the project we brought together our individual skills and interests and developed a shared vision for the product.</description>

      <description>Process Trello board In our project, we managed the process using a Trello board, a helpful tool for organizing tasks and responsibilities. The Kanban board allowed us to efficiently distribute tasks among the team members and track the progress of each assignment. This method facilitated clear communication and coordination throughout the project, ensuring that everyone knew their roles and deadlines. We also held meeting sessions every Monday via Microsoft Teams.</description>

      <description>ðŸ’» Development The project was built upon an existing prototype, reducing the need for starting from scratch. Flutter, a Google-developed open-source framework for cross-platform app development, was chosen for the UI. It utilizes Dart, a programming language tightly integrated with Flutter. The Isar database is a robust Flutter package that seamlessly integrates databases. It offers fast performance, supports various data types, and facilitates efficient data filtering. Additionally, it optimizes offline usage and benefits from a strong community support, making it a reliable data management solution for Flutter applications.</description>

      <description>Uploading Multiple Images It is intended that ShopGPT will support the ability to upload multiple images in the future. This will enable users to provide more detailed visual information about the products they are seeking, allowing for even more accurate and tailored recommendations. Combination of Text and Image Input Currently, the user can either text or upload an image. We want to work towards seamlessly integrating both text and image input simultaneously within ShopGPT.</description>

      <description>ðŸ§Š bloc integration We&amp;rsquo;re planning to expand our Flutter application by integrating Bloc for state management. Bloc will provide us with a more structured approach to handle state, making our codebase cleaner and easier to maintain. ðŸ¤– future models As of now, the only currently available models for fine-tuning from OpenAI will be deprecated and no longer accessible in the near future. Instead, new models like gpt-3.5-turbo or gpt-4 will be made available for fine-tuning in the upcoming months.</description>
