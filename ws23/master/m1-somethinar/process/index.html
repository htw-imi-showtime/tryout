            Developing a Concept
        
    </h3>
    <div class="spacer"></div>
    <div class="content">
        <p>At the beginning of our project, we had a simple goal in mind: to create a game using the <strong>Meta Quest 3 headsets</strong> provided by HTW, with a focus on <strong>multiplayer elements and mixed reality features</strong>. To get our project off the ground, we started with some hands-on exploration. We tested various games that were compatible with the Quest 3, and we even took a trip to Cosmic.VR in Berlin, a virtual reality studio where friends can meet and enjoy VR games together.</p>
<p>Inspired by what worked well and what didn&rsquo;t in our research, we began to outline the essential requirements for our product. We envisioned a <strong>family-friendly game</strong> that would offer players a <strong>quick yet immersive experience</strong> that they can <strong>share together</strong>. The key idea was to introduce an extended world that would leave players with a <strong>&lsquo;wow&rsquo; feeling</strong>, all while keeping them <strong>active and moving</strong>.</p>
<p>Once we had a rough concept in mind, we dug deeper to understand our target audience better. We created <strong>personas</strong> and <strong>user experience maps</strong> to fine-tune our understanding of the players and figure out what would work best in the Showtime setting. Armed with these insights, we refined our game concept and mapped out the entire game process using a <strong>user story map</strong> and a <strong>flowchart</strong>.</p>

            Conducting Technical Research
        
    </h3>
    <div class="spacer"></div>
    <div class="content">
        <p>XR technology is a rapidly evolving field, as we discovered firsthand during our research into the <strong>Meta XR SDK</strong> and <strong>Oculus Integration and Interaction SDK</strong>. We delved deep into VR technology using <strong>Unity</strong>, exploring how it could seamlessly blend with other technologies. Our focus was on <strong>synchronization across multiple headsets</strong> and creating a mixed world within the game that seamlessly combined elements from both the virtual and the real world, in line with our desired effect.</p>
<p>Our research also led us to investigate the <strong>transfer and sharing of spatial data</strong>, as well as the <strong>interaction between real-world objects and virtual elements</strong>. We aimed to integrate these components seamlessly for the <strong>Meta Quest 3</strong>, requiring us to explore various aspects of XR technology to achieve our vision.</p>

            Creating a Product Backlog
        
    </h3>
    <div class="spacer"></div>
    <div class="content">
        <p>Having a clear vision in mind, we got down to the task of creating our product backlog. This comprehensive list included all the features needed for our <strong>MVP (Minimum Viable Product)</strong> as well as those we planned for <strong>future releases</strong>. Building on the User Story Map we developed during the conceptual phase, we translated it into practical tickets, seen from the <strong>perspective of our users</strong>. These tickets included User Stories, Features, and specific tasks.</p>
<p>To streamline our project management, we made use of project planning tools on Github. We organized our work into <strong>weekly or bi-weekly sprints</strong>, each with a distinct focus. Whether it was asset design, network logic, game state implementation, UI design, or other crucial aspects of the project, we allocated our efforts accordingly.</p>

            Implementing and Testing our Features
        
    </h3>
    <div class="spacer"></div>
    <div class="content">
        <p>It was finally time to dive into the nitty-gritty of our project, and let us tell you, we rolled up our sleeves and got our hands dirty! The implementation phase was quite an adventure, filled with its fair share of <strong>challenges</strong>. We encountered unexpected bugs in the SDKs we were working with and had to consistently test and reevaluate our concepts to ensure everything played nice with the Meta Quest 3 and the provided SDK, all within the Unity environment.</p>
<p>Picture this: we were all gathered in a room, each with our headsets on, gesturing and pressing invisible buttons in the air, probably looking quite strange to anyone on the outside. But in the end, all that effort paid off, and we&rsquo;re thrilled to have created <strong>something awesome to share with all of you</strong>.</p>
