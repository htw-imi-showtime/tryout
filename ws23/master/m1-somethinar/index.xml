      <description>Developing a Concept At the beginning of our project, we had a simple goal in mind: to create a game using the Meta Quest 3 headsets provided by HTW, with a focus on multiplayer elements and mixed reality features. To get our project off the ground, we started with some hands-on exploration. We tested various games that were compatible with the Quest 3, and we even took a trip to Cosmic.</description>

      <description>Integrating Meta SDKs with Unity Integrating the Meta XR All-in-One SDK from Oculus presents its own set of challenges. The setup process for this package is complex and sometimes inconsistent. Developers are required to adhere to a strict implementation with limited flexibility for customization.
Additionally, the SDK tends to generate an abundance of debug messages in the console, which are often unnecessary and can obscure more critical information. Another hurdle is the SDK&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;black box&amp;rdquo; backend, which can lead to mysterious errors without a clear source or solution.</description>

      <description>Game Engine Unity Unity provided the core framework for developing our game, offering both 2D and 3D capabilities essential for our project. Networking Photon Fusion 2 We chose Photon Fusion 2 for its handling capabilities of multiplayer game synchronization and networking. XR Interactions Meta XR All-in-One SDK The Meta XR All-in-One SDK was instrumental in implementing immersive XR interactions in our game. Concept &amp;amp; Design Figma Figma was our go-to tool for designing UI elements, thanks to its user-friendly interface and versatility.</description>

      <description>Further Potential of our Game During the initial stages of our game development, we brainstormed numerous ideas that, due to time constraints, couldn&amp;rsquo;t be realized in the current version. This section highlights some of these concepts to showcase the underlying potential and future directions our game could take. Collecting upgrades and special skills One idea we have is to introduce a system where players can collect upgrades and special skills throughout the game.</description>
