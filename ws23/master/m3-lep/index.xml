      <description>UI In the initial stages of development, one key challenge our team faced was designing a user interface (UI) that effectively accommodates the input of constraints and preferences from teachers. Creating a user-friendly and simple UI for teachers to specify their requirements posed a significant hurdle, as it required striking a balance between complexity and user-friendliness. We undertook extensive brainstorming sessions ensuring that it could efficiently capture the nuanced constraints and preferences without overwhelming the teacher.</description>

      <description>Research In the project&amp;rsquo;s initial phase, we conducted thorough research to establish a robust foundation for our web application. This involved exploring diverse technology stacks, evaluating programming languages, databases, and frameworks. We studied similar applications for inspiration and best practices. The implementation of timetable and schedule-solving algorithms was a key focus, with a careful assessment of existing solutions. We directly engaged with the planning team, gaining insights into manual planning methods and specific requirements.</description>

      <description>App Development: Frontend: ReactJS &amp;amp; TypeScript: Our core frontend framework, enabling us to build a dynamic, interactive user interface with type-checking for a reliable and scalable application. React-Bootstrap: Implemented for a uniform look across the web app, ensuring a good user experience with pre-built design patterns and components. CSS Modules: Employed to locally scope CSS by automatically creating a unique class name for each style, ensuring that our styles are consistent and do not conflict with those in other parts of the application.</description>
